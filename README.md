<h5>What will the application do?</h5>
This application will be a cooking assistant for any novice cook. It will take user defined recipes
and present them step by step to the cook in sequential order only once the cook is ready to move on to the next stage.
At the beginning of a cooking session, it will ensure that the cook has the proper ingredients as well as the amounts
needed. The app would then present each step onto the screen, holding there until the user prompts the app to
proceed to the next step. For steps where a cooking timer may be needed, the app will automatically que up the timer 
and
alert the cook when the timer completes.
<h5>Who will use it?</h5>
Individuals such as myself who are interested in learning to cook but want someone to walk them through the steps 
of a recipe. Users would be able to write recipes for other users to cook from, being guided through them with help of 
the app. This application is specially useful for people like to be handheld through each step and don't want to be 
confused by an entire recipe all at once. It will also be of use to forgetful people who don't check that they have all 
the required ingredients before beginning their cooking session.
